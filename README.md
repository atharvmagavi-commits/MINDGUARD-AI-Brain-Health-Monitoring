# MINDGUARD-AI-Brain-Health-Monitoring
This project develops a low-cost single-channel EEG–based brain health monitoring system to detect stress, anxiety, and depression. Using signal filtering, feature extraction, and a TensorFlow neural network, it analyzes brain activity and provides real-time insights, reports, and early mental health screening support.
